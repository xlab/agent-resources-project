# Top 10 Actions to Max Out the Flywheel

## Content & Value (The Foundation)

### 1. Build 5 Killer Skills
Without genuinely valuable resources, nothing else matters. These are both the product AND the marketing.

| Skill | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| `commit` | Daily use, instant value |
| `pr-description` | Saves 10+ min per PR |
| `code-review` | High-value, showcases depth |
| `explain-codebase` | Onboarding pain, very shareable |
| `test-generator` | Universally needed |

**Leverage**: Every great skill gets shared organically.

### 2. Skill Templates by Category

Creators know they want to contribute but don't know WHAT to build. Templates answer "what should I make?"

```
templates/
├── workflow/       # Multi-step processes
├── code-quality/   # Linting, review, refactoring
├── documentation/  # READMEs, comments, docs
├── domain/         # Security, data science, DevOps
└── integration/    # External tools, APIs
```

**Leverage**: Multiplies creator output by lowering the "blank page" barrier.

---

## Discovery & Social Proof

### 3. Launch a Community Directory

README doesn't scale. Need a browsable/searchable index.

**Options** (increasing effort):
- GitHub repo with categorized `awesome-agent-resources` list
- Simple static site (GitHub Pages)
- Full site with search, categories, ratings

**Minimum viable**: A well-organized markdown file with categories.

**Leverage**: Makes discovery possible → more trying → more sharing.

---

### 4. Add Install Analytics & Badges

"1,000 installs" creates FOMO and validates quality.

**Implementation**:
- Track installs via PyPI stats or simple counter
- Add badges to resources: `![installs](badge-url)`
- Show "trending" and "popular" in directory

**Leverage**: Social proof compounds — popular gets more popular.

---

### 5. GitHub "Awesome" List

Awesome lists rank well in search, have built-in credibility, and are highly starred/shared.

**Action**: Create `awesome-claude-code-resources` repo with:
- Curated list of best skills/commands/agents
- Clear categories
- Contribution guidelines

**Leverage**: SEO + credibility + GitHub discovery network.

---

## Creator Activation

### 6. Recruit 10 Creator Champions

Each creator brings their network. 10 active creators = 10x content + 10 distribution channels.

**Playbook**:
1. Identify Claude Code power users (Discord, Twitter, GitHub)
2. Personal outreach: "Would you create a skill? I'll feature you prominently"
3. Help them through their first skill
4. Celebrate and amplify their launch

**Leverage**: Creators become evangelists. Their networks become your reach.

---

### 7. Weekly Creator Spotlight

Recognition motivates contribution. Visibility rewards creators.

**Format**:
- Tweet thread every week featuring a new resource
- "Skill of the Week" in README/directory
- Shoutout to creator with link to their profile

**Leverage**: Creates ongoing content + incentivizes quality.

---

## Reach & Awareness

### 8. Create a 90-Second Video Demo

Video is the most shareable format. Shows the full magic in action.

**Script**:
```
0:00 - "Watch this" → uvx add-skill kasperjunge/commit
0:15 - Use it, show value
0:30 - "Want to make your own?"
0:35 - uvx create-agent-resources-repo --github
0:50 - Edit, push, share
1:10 - "Your turn" + CTA
```

**Leverage**: Evergreen content that can be shared everywhere.

---

### 9. Anthropic/Claude Code Integration

Official recognition = massive credibility + reach multiplier.

**Actions**:
- Submit to Claude Code documentation as community resource
- Engage with Anthropic DevRel on Twitter/Discord
- Create resources that showcase Claude Code capabilities
- Propose for official mention or partnership

**Leverage**: Access to Anthropic's entire user base.

---

### 10. Creator Referral Program

Make creators recruit creators. Exponential growth.

**Mechanism**:
- "Brought to you by" attribution in skills
- Leaderboard: "Top contributors this month"
- Feature creators who onboard other creators
- Potential: Swag/recognition for top contributors

**Leverage**: Turns linear growth into exponential.
