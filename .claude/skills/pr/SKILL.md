# PR Description Generator

Generate pull request descriptions that reviewers will love.

## Workflow

1. Gather context (diff, commits, related files)
2. Analyze the changes (what changed, why it matters)
3. Generate description following the template
4. Output ready-to-use markdown

## Step 1: Gather Context

Run these commands to understand the changes:

```bash
# Get the diff (staged + unstaged)
git diff HEAD

# If on a feature branch, get diff from main
git diff main...HEAD

# Get recent commits on this branch
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# Get commit messages with bodies
git log main..HEAD --format="%B---"
```

## Step 2: Analyze Changes

For each changed file, identify:
- **What**: The technical change made
- **Why**: The purpose/motivation (infer from context, commit messages, code comments)
- **Impact**: What this affects (features, performance, security, etc.)

Look for clues in:
- Commit messages
- Code comments (especially TODOs resolved)
- Test files (they reveal intent)
- Related documentation changes

## Step 3: Generate Description

Use this template:

```markdown
## Summary

[1-2 sentences: What does this PR do and why?]

## Changes

[Bullet list of key changes, grouped logically]

- **[Area/Component]**: [What changed]
- **[Area/Component]**: [What changed]

## Testing

[How was this tested? What should reviewers verify?]

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing of [specific flows]
- [ ] [Any other relevant checks]

## Notes for Reviewers

[Optional: Anything reviewers should pay attention to, questions you have, or context that helps review]

## Quality Standards

### Summary
- Lead with the WHY, not just the WHAT
- Be specific: "Fix login timeout" > "Fix bug"
- One PR = one purpose (if not, note it)

### Changes
- Group related changes together
- Highlight breaking changes prominently
- Note any migrations or setup steps needed

### Testing
- Be specific about what was tested
- Include manual testing steps if relevant
- Note any areas that need extra review attention

## Examples

### Good Summary
> Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks. Limits to 5 attempts per minute per IP, with exponential backoff.

### Bad Summary
> Fix auth issues

### Good Changes Section
```markdown
## Changes

- **Auth**: Add rate limiter middleware with Redis backend
- **Config**: New `RATE_LIMIT_*` environment variables
- **Tests**: Add rate limiting integration tests
- **Docs**: Update API documentation with rate limit headers
```

### Bad Changes Section
```markdown
## Changes

- Changed auth.ts
- Changed config.ts
- Added tests
```

## Handling Edge Cases

**Large PRs**: Group changes by feature/area, add a "Overview" section at top

**Refactoring PRs**: Emphasize that behavior is unchanged, note what was restructured and why

**Bug fixes**: Include what was broken, root cause, and how the fix addresses it

**Dependencies**: Note any new dependencies and why they were chosen
